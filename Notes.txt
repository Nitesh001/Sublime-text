1) Press Ctrl at place and type same text at multiple places.
2) Select same word at multiple places by using ctrl+d. (kind of find and replace)
3) ctrl+shift+L: select multiple lines together and each line will be turned into editable region(To turn each line into editable region).
4) alt+shift+w: For wrapping the text. For multiple lines wrapping use, ctrl+shift+L and then alt+shift+w. Ctrl+shift+v gives smart pasting (with indentation)
5) ctrl+shift+arrow : To move statemnt up or down.
6) ctrl+shift+d: For duplicating an item (no need to select an item, just put cursor on that item)
7) ctrl+shift+k: For remove/delete items
8) ctrl+P: To open any file, press '@' when you want to open some method in that file. Same is possible in case of CSS file and HTML file.
9)  For reaching to particular line, ctrl+p, search file press colon (:) and now line number
10) For searching in same file, ctrl+P, press '@' and type method name or : type line number.Also use '#ANY_WORD' to see first occurance of that word in the file.
11) You can see unsaved changes before saving content. Just right click and you will see option 'show unsaved changes'.
12) ctrl+shift+P: For opening command pallete (search for upper case, lower case, set syntax etc.)
13) ctrl+shift+P: For opening package manager window and start searching anything like, 'install package'.
14) Snippets:
a) Type 'fun' and hit tab, it will create function snippet.
b) Type 'ife' and hit tab, it will create if else block.
c) For html, save file as .html, now type html and hit tab.
d) Type 'div' and hit tab.
e) Use Emmit plugin for more snippets feature. (For Emmet package, search 'Emmet' in command palate)
Use > for child elements, Use + for siblings. Use () for separate HTML blocks. Use tab for autocompletion of tag elements.
like,
ul>li.item-$*3 = 
<ul>
  <li class="item-1"></li>
  <li class="item-2"></li>
  <li class="item-3"></li>
</ul>

like, (div>span.new+ul>li*3)+(article>div.art) (no spaces)
<div>
 <span class="new"></span>
 <ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
</div>
<article>
  <div class="art"></div>
</article>	

f) More better feature that Emmet plugin provides is live structure creation around the text.

Select multiple lines with ctrl+shift+L and use ctrl+shift+G to allow Emmet special structure syntax to be written.
Now if you write Emmet special syntax like, ul.>li-item$$>span etc.
You will see live structure creation around your text.

 For indentation, Edit -> Line -> Reindent
 
 For right indent, ctrl+],
 For left indent, ctrl+[

 For CSS we can use,

 mb10 = margin-bottom:10px
 pb5 = padding-bottom:5px
 dn = display:none
 db = display:block   
 w87p = width: 87%;

Custom snippets and placeholders can also be created (watch video tut less8, LearnWebcode)

 sublime.log_commands(True);

File -> New view into file for opening same file again 

 Rubik's cube:

 1. Making the cross: F R U R' U' F' 
(Dot [in any orientation], then L shape [with tips pointing down and to the right], and then the [horizontal] line)

2. Aligning the cross: R U2 R' U' R U' R'
(One correct piece facing you and one facing away, then one incorrect facing you and one to the right)

one right side facing you, remaining three adjacent top corner and lower half other side.
 R U U R' U' R U' R'


3. Placing corners: L' U R U' L U R' U'
(Any orientation if all corners false. Otherwise, correct corner on bottom right)

4. Final Step: R U2 R' U' R U' R' L' U2 L U L' U L
(Keep false corners on bottom right and, if possible, top right).
